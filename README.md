#How to use
To use the simulation, open MatLab Simulink. Then click on _Open..._ in the upper left corner of the Simulink window and select the downloaded Simulation.slx file.
If you just want to run the simulation click on run simulation. Otherwise, enjoy snooping around, changing values or even implementing your own control system!
